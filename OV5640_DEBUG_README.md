## 🧪 Diagnostic Test Suite Components

### 1. I2C Bus Scanner
**Purpose**: Scans all I2C addresses to detect connected devices

**What it does**:
- Tests addresses 0x01 to 0x7F (1-127)
- Shows both 7-bit and 8-bit address formats
- Counts total devices found

**Expected Output**:
```
=== I2C Bus Scanner ===
Scanning I2C1 bus for devices...
✓ Device found at address 0x3C (7-bit) / 0x78 (8-bit)

### 2. OV5640 I2C Communication Test
**Purpose**: Tests basic I2C communication with OV5640 specifically

**What it does**:
- Tests device readiness at address 0x3C
- Reads chip ID high byte (register 0x300A, should be 0x56)
- Reads chip ID low byte (register 0x300B, should be 0x40)
- Combines and verifies full chip ID (should be 0x5640)

**Expected Output**:
```
=== OV5640 I2C Communication Test ===
Testing device ready at 0x3C...
✓ OV5640 responds to I2C address 0x3C
Reading chip ID registers...
✓ Chip ID High: 0x56
✓ Chip ID Low: 0x40

```
=== OV5640 Initialization Test ===
System Control Register (0x3008): 0x02
Testing soft reset...
✓ Soft reset command sent
System Control after reset: 0x82
Waking up camera from standby...
✓ Wake up command sent
System Control after wake up: 0x02
✓ Camera successfully woken up
```

**Troubleshooting**:

### Common Failure Patterns

#### Pattern 1: No I2C Devices Found
```
Step 2: I2C Bus Scanner ✗ (no devices found)
```
**Root Cause**: Hardware connection issues
**Solutions**:
- Check PB6 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA) connections
- Verify 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors on both lines
- Check camera power (3.3V) and ground connections
- Verify I2C1 peripheral is enabled in STM32CubeMX

#### Pattern 2: Device Found but Wrong Chip ID
```
Step 2: I2C Bus Scanner ✓ (device at 0x3C)
Step 3: OV5640 I2C Communication ✗ (wrong or no chip ID)
```
**Root Cause**: Wrong camera module or communication timing
**Solutions**:
- Verify you have an OV5640 module (not OV7725, OV2640, etc.)
- Check I2C timing configuration (400kHz recommended)
- Verify 16-bit register addressing is working
- Check camera module power supply voltage (3.3V)

#### Pattern 3: Basic I2C Works but Register Access Fails
```
Step 2: I2C Bus Scanner ✓
Step 3: OV5640 I2C Communication ✓
Step 4: Register Access ✗ (read/write failures)
```
**Root Cause**: I2C communication integrity issues
**Solutions**:
- Reduce I2C speed (try 100kHz instead of 400kHz)
- Check for electrical noise or interference
- Verify pull-up resistor values (try 2.2kΩ if 4.7kΩ doesn't work)
- Check cable length and quality

#### Pattern 4: Everything Works but BSP Init Fails
```
Steps 1-5: All pass ✓
Step 6: BSP Driver ✗ (OV5640_Init fails)
```
**Root Cause**: Camera configuration or timing issues
**Solutions**:
- Check XCLK signal (PA8 should output 24MHz)
- Verify DCMI pin configurations
- Check camera power sequencing
- Try different resolution/format combinations

## 🛠️ Advanced Troubleshooting

### I2C Timing Issues
If you see intermittent failures, try adjusting I2C timing in STM32CubeMX:
- **Standard mode**: 100kHz
- **Fast mode**: 400kHz
- **Custom timing**: Calculate based on your specific setup

### Power Sequencing
Proper OV5640 power-up sequence:
1. Apply power (3.3V)
2. Wait 1-2ms
3. Release reset (set high)
4. Wait 1-2ms
5. Provide XCLK (24MHz)
6. Wait 1-2ms
7. Begin I2C communication

### Register Debugging
To debug specific register issues:
```c
// Read any register manually
uint8_t value;
HAL_StatusTypeDef status = HAL_I2C_Mem_Read(&hi2c1, 0x3C << 1,
    0x300A, I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_16BIT, &value, 1, 1000);
printf("Register 0x300A: 0x%02X, Status: %d\r\n", value, status);
```
